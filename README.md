# gcmap-publish

This is a port of [Seth Miller's WordPress plugin](https://blog.wandr.me/plugins/great-circle-mapper/) to [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish), using Karl L. Swartz's fantastic [gcmap maps](http://www.gcmap.com). These maps are focused on air routes around the world shown in a [great circle / orthodromic style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_navigation) with [great circle distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance).

This plugin only requires a path; other parameters are optional.
